## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload** a video or play a song.  
2. **AI analyzes** the rhythm, tempo, and movement.  
3. **Feedback & guidance** is generated live via motion tracking and music sync.  
4. **Style suggestions** or auto-generated choreography appear.  
5. **Learn in AR** or use chatbot for dance theory and technique tips.
